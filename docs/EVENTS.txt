Events
	•	beforeInsert (view)
	      differentiate HTML from XML?
	•	load (view) - Executed before any transition is started (only first time loaded)
	•	unload (view) (only called on "back button" click -- is this really needed? Issue #132)
            Could patch #132 use the onBlur event and then see if it is an unload as
            a special case?  (if we can detect the onBlur was caused by back button)
	•	onFocus (view)
	•	onBlur (view)
	•   beforeTransition
	•   afterTransition

3 - transition to view
4 - transition from fiew
5 - 
	      
Use Case #1 // LOAD VIEW

  1) (C-G) beforeInsert called 
  2) (C-G) view inserted
  3) (C-G) (view plugin) registered CSS selectors run (against body??) to see if new view matches
           any of them.  If so viewHandler is attached to the view.
     A-B view plugin CSS selectors run against all pre-loaded views
        attach view to page
  2) loadView called when HTML page is loaded (page has an inited flag)
        A - called from showPage if inited flag not set (from body onload)
        B-G - called from showPage if inited flag not set
  3) onFocus - called from showPage
  
  Note: beforeInsert is never called since the view is in the initial dom
  
  
Use case #1b - transition from default page
  1) onBlur called
  
  Note: onUnload will never be called because the default pageis never unlaoded (?)
  
Use case #1
