The iui directory has been moved into the web-app directory at web-app/iui

The reason for this change is because the web-app directory represents "document root"
or the root of the portion of the project that should be served with a webserver
for development, testing, or deployment.

Note: There is now a symbolic link 'iui' that points to 'web-app/iui' that should work on
the Mac OS X or Linux platforms.
